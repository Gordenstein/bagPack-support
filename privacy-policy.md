# BagPack Privacy Policy

Last Updated: October 25, 2025

**BagPack** ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use the BagPack app ("the App") on iOS devices. By using BagPack, you agree to the practices described below.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Personal Information
BagPack does not require you to provide personal information (e.g., name, email, or phone number) to use the App. Any data you enter, such as packing templates or checklists, is considered **User-Generated Content**.

### User-Generated Content
- **Templates and Checklists**: Items you add to templates or checklists (e.g., “Passport,” “Sunscreen”) are stored locally on your device.
- **Search Data**: Search queries within the App are processed locally and not transmitted to us.

### Non-Personal Information
We do not collect analytics, usage data, or device identifiers unless explicitly enabled by you in future updates (e.g., optional crash reporting). Any such features will require your explicit consent.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
- **Local Storage**: User-Generated Content (templates, checklists) is stored on your device to provide the App’s core functionality (creating, managing, and searching packing lists).
- **App Functionality**: Search queries and checklist actions (e.g., checking off or archiving items) are processed locally to deliver a fast, responsive experience.

## 3. Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or disclose your User-Generated Content or any other data to third parties, except:
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose data if required by law or to protect the safety, rights, or property of BagPack or its users.

## 4. Data Security
- **Local Storage**: All data is stored securely on your device using iOS 26’s built-in security features.
- We implement reasonable measures to protect your data but cannot guarantee absolute security due to the nature of digital systems.

## 5. Your Choices
- **Data Deletion**: Delete templates or checklists directly in the App. To remove all data, uninstall BagPack or clear data via your device’s settings.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new features or legal requirements. The latest version will be posted here, with the “Last Updated” date revised. Significant changes will be communicated via the App or our website.
